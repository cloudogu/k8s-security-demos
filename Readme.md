# Overview

Initially, these demos were developed during the preparation for some talks on [Kubernetes appOps Security](https://github.com/cloudogu/k8s-appops-security-talks) and our [K8s application security training](https://cloudogu.com/en/trainings/).

See also our [series of blog posts](#blog-posts) on the topic.

Tested to run on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) with a local Linux machine.  
Should also work on Mac.  
Should run on all clusters that support NetworkPolicies and PodSecurityPolicies.


1. ~~Role Based Access Controll (RBAC)~~ - RBAC has now been default for years. 
A showcase for the downsides of ABAC seems obsolete. 
If you're interested check [git history](https://github.com/cloudogu/k8s-security-demos/tree/b94aa0a94358cc04f3f1beed80f755ac14b994da).
2. [Network Policies](2-network-policies/Readme.md)
3. [Security Context](3-security-context/Readme.md)
4. [Pod Security Policies](4-pod-security-policies/Readme.md)

# Running the demos

Each demo is contained in its own sub folder, where each contains a 
 
* `apply.sh` that deploys the applications required for the demos and
* `README.md` that contains the steps of the demo

Note that the scripts also create entries to your `/etc/hosts`.

All Demos run inside the same cluster. Before running make sure to have your `kubeconfig` set to a non-productive cluster.
If you want, you can set one up on your GKE account using the script inside this repo. 
See [Setting up the clusters](#setting-up-the-clusters).

# Setting up the clusters

This demos should run on most kubernetes clusters that have support for NetworkPolicies and PodSecurityPolicies.

This repo also features setting up a defined environment Google Kubernetes engine. 
You can set it up using [createCluster.sh](createCluster.sh).  
It uses terraform to roll out the clusters. If you prefer a bash-only variant, check [git history](https://github.com/cloudogu/k8s-security-demos/tree/b94aa0a94358cc04f3f1beed80f755ac14b994da).

In order to use the script

* set your GKE `ZONE` and `PROJECT` in `config.sh`  
  (alternatively, you can set these properties via env vars).  
  Note that you can also set `CLUSTER_VERSION` (like `1.11`) and  `MACHINE_TYPE` (like `n1-standard-2`).
  From time to time GKE drops support for older cluster versions, so you might need to set a newer one, if the one in 
  `config.sh` is no longer supported at the time of execution. 
* set up a service account on GKE that allows terraform to do the setup
```shell script
source config.sh
SA=terraform-cluster

# Create SA
gcloud iam service-accounts create ${SA} --display-name ${SA} --project ${PROJECT}

# Authorize (maybe roles/container.admin is enough?) 
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${PROJECT} \
  --member serviceAccount:${SA}@${PROJECT}.iam.gserviceaccount.com --role=roles/editor

# Export credentials
gcloud iam service-accounts keys create \
  --iam-account ${SA}@${PROJECT}.iam.gserviceaccount.com terraform/account.json
``` 
* Have terraform installed (should work with 0.12 and 0.13)
* Call `./create Cluster.sh`
* Terraform will ask for confirmation before executing.   
  If you don't want that, call `./createCluster.sh -auto-approve`

## Deleting clusters 

You can delete the cluster and entries to `/etc/hosts` once you're done using the `./delete-clusters.sh` script. 

## Costs 

For just a quick create, demo, delete action the cost should be < 10$.
The total infra cost for initially creating these demos was about 10$.
